## Announcements

- Saturday will include the class 14 lecture, so please try to be on time in the morning. We will also have our first round of project pitches before lunch. Saturday's lab will include finishing the Bus Mall project and completing another pair assignment, so plan your time accordingly. Both of these assignments are due Saturday night.

- Monday is July 4th, so we will have the final lecture and final project pitches on Tuesday. This means Wednesday night will be facilitated lab time, during which we can start project week.

- **The Code 301 entrance exam will be published tomorrow.** You have until Friday (7/15) of week 8 to complete it, but try to submit it sooner rather than later if you plan to continue immediately with 301 - this will allow us to secure your spot and proceed with the admissions process.

## Group Projects

- If you have a project idea to pitch, prepare a one-minute 'elevator pitch' that you can deliver Saturday or Tuesday. We'll keep a record of all the project ideas and select projects/teams Tuesday night.
