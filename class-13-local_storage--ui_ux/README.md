## UI & UX discussion

Let's do a discussion on UI/UX and take a look at some sample student projects from prior classes to evaluate their how they look, how they feel, and how easy they are to use. Let's also look at a few websites relating to design and interaction.

- [5 Ridiculously Common Misconceptions about UX](https://www.sitepoint.com/5-ridiculously-common-misconceptions-about-ux/)

When you start with your own projects, one of the things you will be fully responsible for is UI and UX.
