# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 10

Put the finishing touches on your campfire coffee site. The data.html page should show a table with all the shops and include a form to allow the user to add a new shop. The index.html page should use the images included in the class06 directory and provide some detail about the shops - locations, hours, the mission of the business, etc.

Also create a style guide for your campfire coffee site. It should show guidelines for:
- typography
  - fonts used (render different types of text using the fonts & colors that appear on the site)
  - font sizes for H1 - H6, regular text, numbers
  - bold and italic text
  - links (include active/hover if you have different colors for these)
  - font colors
- color palette
  - color swatches with hex or rgba codes
- important theme elements (e.g. buttons, inputs, tables)
